  * How are the binomial distribution and the Poisson distribution similar? How are they different?

    <blockquote>

    Both the binomial distribution and the Poisson distribution use a summary value--the probability of success on a single trial for the binomial distribution, and the rate of events per time period for the Poisson distribution--as the fundamental parameter for their construction. Also, each distribution is constructed by a plotting the probabilities of the number of these fundamental units occurring within some frame, i.e., the probability of _k_ successes in _n_ Bernoulli trials for the binomial distribution and the probability of _k_ events occurring within a given timeframe for the Poisson distribution. Finally, both the binomial and Poisson distributions assume independent events for their respective cases. The primary difference between the two distributions is that the binomial distribution is concerned with frequencies of events in a fixed number of trials, whereas Poisson distributions are concerned frequencies of events in a fixed timeframe.

  * True or False: The mean of a Poisson distribution can be any real number.

    <blockquote>

    False. The mean of a Poisson distribution is <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\lambda">, the number of events we expect observe in the timeframe--aka, "the rate". The rate would be a natural number (including zero) over a positive real number (a timeframe), meaning the rate must be a nonnegative real number.

    </blockquote>

  * What is the relationship between the mean and variance of a Poisson distribution?

    <blockquote>

    Since the standard deviation of the Poisson distribution is the square root of the mean, the variance of the Poisson distribution is equal to the mean(!).
